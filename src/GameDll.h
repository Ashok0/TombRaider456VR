// GameDll.h -- the game state that lives in tomb4.dll / tomb5.dll rather than in
// tomb456.exe, and the address table that reaches it.
//
// This file owns the BINDING (which DLL, where it is loaded, which build, and
// every RVA inside it). Two small readers live here as well -- Lara's water
// status and the camera's headroom -- because they are field reads and nothing
// more. The room culling that uses the rest of the table is in PortalCull.cpp.
//
// THIS REPLACES RoomCull.h, AND THE REASON IS THE PDBs
//
// Everything here used to be reverse engineered: `FUN_18002ea30` for the portal
// traversal, `DAT_18063dc60` for the draw list, a whole-data-section memory diff
// to find lara.water_status. tomb4.dll and tomb5.dll ship PRIVATE PDBs, so all
// of it now comes out of dbghelp by name:
//
//   python tools\pdbdump.py  <dir>\tomb4.dll  draw_rooms w2v_matrix PrintRoomsList
//   python tools\typedump.py <dir>\tomb4.dll  ROOM_INFO camera_info
//   python tools\verify_addresses.py          re-derives and diffs all of them
//
// Every address the old table had came back identical, which is the cross-check
// that says the reverse engineering was right -- including the two that were
// hardest to trust:
//
//   * `camX/camY/camZ` = 0x0049484C/5C/6C are w2v_matrix[3], [7] and [11].
//     They were three separate globals in the old table; they are one matrix.
//   * `laraWaterStatus` = 0x004F2E4C is `lara` + 12, exactly where TR1-3's PDBs
//     put lara_info::water_status. The memory diff found the right field.
//
// TR4 and TR5 have IDENTICAL struct layouts -- 304-byte ROOM_INFO with
// door/x/y/z/maxceiling/bound_active at +8/+40/+44/+48/+56/+75 and the clip rect
// at +76..+82, 112-byte camera_info -- so there is one struct description and a
// per-build address table. TR6 is a different engine and has its own row type,
// Tr6Layout, below.
//
// TWO BUILDS OF EACH DLL ARE SUPPORTED: the debug release that ships PDBs (what
// all of this was reverse engineered against) and the retail Steam release.
// The retail rows have no PDB to be read from; they were carried across with
// tools\port_addresses.py, which matches the two builds function by function
// and data reference by data reference, and every one was then re-checked.

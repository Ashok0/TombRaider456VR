    //
    // THE BUG IT FIXES. The dot is not a world object. DrawBinoculars' LaserSight
    // branch takes target_mesh_ptr, scales it to the screen rect and writes it
    // into raw_vbuf with z = 0, reached from S_OutputPolyList -- it is a
    // screen-centre crosshair in the 2D overlay pass. The shot is real geometry:
    // BinocularCamera_TR4/TR5 raycast camera.pos -> camera.target through
    // GetTargetOnLOS and the impact comes out of TriggerRicochetSpark at the
    // clipped hit point. So the crosshair and the impact are two points on ONE
    // LINE out of camera.pos -- which is why they agree perfectly on a flat
    // screen, and why they cannot agree in VR: the mod draws the crosshair on the
    // flat panel at hudDepthMetres while the impact is at the wall, and two
    // points on a line project to the same pixel only from an eye that is ON that
    // line. Measured error is h*(D/Z - 1) for a head offset h: 0.3 m of head at a
    // 10 m target with a 4 m panel is 0.45 m, and it reads as vertical because
    // seated your lateral offset is nearly zero while your vertical one is not.
    //
    // WHY THE IPD CAN STAY, which is the whole reason this does not cost depth:
    // the crosshair sits at (0, 0, -Z) in the camera's frame -- on the aim axis
    // for ANY panel depth -- and with the head centre back on camera.pos the
    // MIDPOINT between the eyes is on the aim line even though neither pupil is.
    // The two eyes' errors are equal and opposite, so they cancel in the fused
    // direction and what is left is the dot appearing to float in front of the
    // wall instead of resting on it. A vergence artefact, not an aiming error.
    //
    // WHAT IT COSTS: raising an optic moves your viewpoint to the game camera,

    // do. It is bounded by how far your head is from the camera, it happens on a

    //       invisible to them: no parallax, no depth, everything at infinity (so
    //       it reads oversized), IpdScale and WorldUnitsPerMetre inert. A per-eye

    //       ALSO BROKEN, differently: skinned geometry is transformed by

    //       world and end up floating outside the map. Chasing every transform
    //       path is a losing game.

    //   3 = uProjMatrix composed with the WHOLE per-eye transform, and the view
    //       matrix left completely untouched. THE FIX.
    //
    //       With the game's own view matrix in place both shader families agree
    //       exactly: full-dot gives R_g*w + t_g, and rotation-only gives R_g*p
    //       with p = w + R_g^T*t_g, which is the same R_g*w + t_g. They only
    //       diverge once the view matrix is modified. So don't modify it --
    //       fold the eye transform E = [R_e | t_e] into the projection:
    //           clip = P * (R_e*v + t_e) = (P * E) * v
    //       One multiply, rotation and translation together, correct for both
    //       families by construction.
    //
    //       Mode 2's head-movement blow-up came from d = (R_e - I)*t_g + t_e:
    //       t_g is ~82000 units, so any head rotation made the first term
    //       thousands of units. E is metres-scale, so this cannot happen here.
    //
    //   2 = uProjMatrix, post-multiplied by translate(d). Gives correct depth and
    //       working scale keys, but the world swims when you rotate your head,
    //       for the reason above. Superseded by 3.
    //       Every one of the 125 shaders ends with uProjMatrix * vec4(view, 1.0),
    //       so this is the one matrix nothing can bypass -- joints included. A
    //       view-space shift d is exactly equivalent to P * translate(d):
    //           clip.x += m[0]*dx + m[4]*dy + m[8]*dz
